# CVWO 2024 Assignment Frontend

Name: Josh Thoo Jen Sen

This is the progress of my React-TypeScript backend as of 25 January 2024.

I will be doing my own changes to enhance this forum website, as I want to learn more. Please consider looking at my working frontend repository which I will commit to beyond the deadline: https://github.com/josh1248/forum-website-frontend

This React app can handle:
- Users: View of users, ability to create users (which you can verify by viewing users), login check of users, including passwords. Accepting cookies with JWT upon successful login.
- Posts: View of posts.

I did not implement:
- Users: Deletion of users, administrator capabilities.
- Posts: creating, deleting, updating posts. Creating posts based on JWT, which would have allowed auto-fill of username when creating the post.
- Comments: comments in posts.

## Getting Started

### Running the app

1. You should first set-up the backend through which this frontend will connect to. You can find the repo containing the backend snapshot [here](https://github.com/josh1248/cvwo-assignment-24-backend).
2. Ensure that the backend server is running.
3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repo.
4. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) **your** forked repo.
5. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your cloned project.
6. Install dependencies for the project by entering this command:

```bash
yarn install
```

7. Run the app in development mode by entering this command:

```bash
yarn start
```

8. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
9. You should be able to see a `Hello, World!` greeting, with 4 links to different parts of this website.


### Implementation Details

-   This project uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
-   This project uses [MUI](https://mui.com/). It has also bootstrapped the [Register / Login page templates](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/).
-   ESLint and pretierrc are used, but ignore the templated pages above due to different coding syntax conventions.
-   Axios is used as a framework for communications with the backend.
-   react-dom-router is used to handle routing across the website.
-   

The file structure of the `src` folder is shown below. It is generated by the `file-tree-generator` extension at VSCode for free use.
